# Spotify Million Song Dataset - K-Means Clustering

This project uses the **Spotify Million Song Dataset** to apply **K-Means clustering** on song lyrics. The goal is to group songs with similar lyrics together, allowing for easier categorization and analysis of music.

## Dataset Overview

The **Spotify Million Song Dataset** contains the following key features:

- **Artist**: Name of the artist
- **Song**: Title of the song
- **Link**: URL to the song on Spotify
- **Text**: Lyrics of the song

The dataset provides a large collection of song data with over **44,824 unique songs**. The lyrics of these songs are used for clustering, allowing us to identify patterns and group songs with similar themes.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms and vectorization
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `numpy` for numerical operations

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
